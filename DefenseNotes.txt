Why choose vector
{
    Vector: contiguous memory, fast indexing for building the main chain and binary searches.
} 

why choose deque
{
    Deque: allows efficient push/pop at both ends while still supporting indexing for the main chain. Lists would make binary search slow.
}

What is merge insertion, and specifically the role of pairs.
{
    Merge-insertion is a sorting method that first splits the
    elements into pairs of two, sorts each pair so the larger
    element is first, and then builds a sorted “main chain”
    from all the larger elements. The smaller elements in
    each pair—called the pend elements—are then inserted into
    the main chain in a specific order (often following the
    Jacobsthal sequence) using binary search. Pairs are
    crucial because they let the algorithm reduce the total
    number of comparisons: each pair only requires one
    comparison to order, and the pend elements are inserted
    efficiently afterward.
}

What is the Jacobsthal sequence and its relevance.
{
    The Jacobsthal sequence is a series of numbers defined
    recursively. In merge-insertion, it determines the order
    in which the smaller elements of the pairs (pend elements)
    are inserted into the main chain. Using the Jacobsthal
    sequence minimizes comparisons by spreading insertions
    efficiently across the partially sorted chain, rather than
    inserting strictly left-to-right.
}

Why deque is slower than vector.
{
    Deque is slower than vector mainly because of memory layout.
    Vector stores elements contiguously in a single block, so
    accessing or iterating is cache-friendly and insertion at
    the end is usually O(1) amortized. Deque uses multiple chunks
    of memory, so random access can be slightly slower and
    insertions in the middle require more pointer hopping and
    sometimes moving elements between blocks.
